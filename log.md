# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read & implemented the Ford Fulkerson algorithm & the problem of minimum s-t cut.

**Thoughts:** The algorithm was a bit hard to grasp at first, but coding the same definitely goes a long way in really understanding it.

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Maximum Bipartite matching, Push Relabel algorithm, Bridges in graph

**Thoughts:** The concept of flow and articulation points seems quite useful in many practical applications.

### Day 2: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Euler's totient function, Segmented Sieve, Extended Euclidean Algorithm, Modular Multiplicative Inverse

**Thoughts:** Today I really felt low at certain times and felt like quitting, but the quest for the challenge kept me going.

### Day 3: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Chinese Remainder Theorem, Lucas theorem & Sum-string problem

**Thoughts:** Completing the sum-string problem gave me a real joy and I have decided to properly comment all my code so that it would be easier for someone reading it to understand what's happening.

### Day 4: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Matrix Multiplication Problem, Longest Substring Problem

**Thoughts:** I realize I am doing silly mistakes even though I come up with a first solution reasonably quickly. Need to practise speed more.

### Day 5: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Image Processing Course - Quantization & Sampling, Image Compression

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying this course which is justifying the excitement which I always get when I think about "Image Processing".
