# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read & implemented the Ford Fulkerson algorithm & the problem of minimum s-t cut.

**Thoughts:** The algorithm was a bit hard to grasp at first, but coding the same definitely goes a long way in really understanding it.

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Maximum Bipartite matching, Push Relabel algorithm, Bridges in graph

**Thoughts:** The concept of flow and articulation points seems quite useful in many practical applications.

### Day 2: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Euler's totient function, Segmented Sieve, Extended Euclidean Algorithm, Modular Multiplicative Inverse

**Thoughts:** Today I really felt low at certain times and felt like quitting, but the quest for the challenge kept me going.
